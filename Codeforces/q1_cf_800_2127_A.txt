Statement :

You are given an array a consisting of n non-negative integers. However, some elements of a are missing, represented by -1.

Summary :
You have an array a of length n where some entries are -1 (missing). The array is called good if MEX(a) equals MIN(a) + MAX(a). You need to fill each -1 with a non-negative integer so the array becomes good, or report that it is impossible. There are t test cases. Input gives n and the array for each test. Output YES if you can fill the missing values to make the array good, otherwise NO.
